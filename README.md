## Theory Abstraction

### Usage
  1. Place 'theoryOne.h' inside source directory
  2. Include 'theoryOne.h' in file
  3. All constants and labels are in `theory` namespace 
      - On VS Code, should be able to autocomplete 
      - Add `using namespace theory` to declare Notes, Chords, and Scales without code getting too verbose

### Documentation

- [Note](doc/note.md)
- [Chord](doc/chord.md)
- [Scale](doc/scale.md)
